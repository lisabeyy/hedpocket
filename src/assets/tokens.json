Users can swap tokens, provide liquidity, farm, and stake in a fully permissionless environment.\n\nSAUCE is a transferable representation of attributed utility functions; namely, liquidity, staking, and governance, specified in the code. It is therefore designed to be a utility token essential to the SaucerSwap protocol. \n\n200 million SAUCE tokens were minted at genesis, while the remaining 800 million are brought into circulation according to the release schedule. The total supply of SAUCE is hard-capped and will not exceed 1 billion tokens. There are no lockup periods or private sales of the SAUCE token.\n\nSAUCE has the following essential utilities:\n\nGovernance - SaucerSwap will phase in a DAO, where SAUCE holders can create and vote on proposals to steer protocol development and management. Votes will be proportional to the amount of SAUCE in a user's account.\n\nStaking - the token plays an integral role in single-sided staking and Community Pools. Users can stake SAUCE to receive a percentage of swap fees, HBAR native staking rewards, and emissions. By staking SAUCE, a user immediately receives xSAUCE tokens as receipt of the liquidity they provided, which they can then add to liquidity pools or stake in Community Pools to stack their rewards. \n\nLiquidity - newly minted SAUCE serves as a liquidity mining incentive to offset impermanent loss and bootstrap liquidity on the protocol. \n\nPayments - SAUCE will serve as the exclusive method of payment for several SaucerSwap ecosystem integrations, including a subscription-based model that offers real-time notifications, insights, advanced analytics, and UX customization.",

Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. \n\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage. \n\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",

Two weeks prior to the outbreak, the scientist vanished without a trace, leaving his colleagues and subordinates to pick up the pieces. In his place appeared an unattractive elderly elf-like creature with terrible speaking skills and a habit of sprinkling unfamiliar foreign coins as he paced through the lab. No one knew where he had come from, or how he had suddenly taken over the research team, but his presence only added to the sense of unease and confusion.\n\nAs the outbreak worsened, it became clear that the virus had found its way onto the Hedera network, infecting users around the world who had interacted with the original patients. Panic began to set in as people realized just how widespread the virus had become, and governments around the world scrambled to contain the outbreak.",

Trader Joe v1 offers users an accessible and convenient way to provide passive liquidity and trade tokens. However, this protocol design does have drawbacks, such as capital inefficiencies and high risks of impermanent loss.\n\nTrader Joe v2 uses a new protocol: Liquidity Book. One of the key changes that the Liquidity Book protocol implements is concentrated liquidity. This way of stacking liquidity offers vast improvements over the traditional AMM models by being very capital efficient. Users can choose what prices they want to provide liquidity for instead of utilising the 0 to infinity range. The Liquidity Book design allows LPs to easily develop custom strategies matching their own goals and risk profile. Instead of having one pool with unbound price ranges, Liquidity Book has multiple separate bins with different prices that can be used as building blocks for a liquidity position. Those looking to capture maximum fees and willing to take some risk can deposit all their tokens into one bin. Others can choose a more balanced approach with bespoke liquidity structures.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",

This is why Karate Combat is embracing the latest advancements in internet-native technology to move league governance to a DAO format. \n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a self-governing system that uses computer programs (smart contracts) to run itself. Karate Combat will be the first sports league structured to incorporate input from DAO in the league’s processes for making key decisions. Products, orgs, and sports leagues built by the community can really live forever. \n\nThe KARATE token is the official digital currency in the KarateDAO and it gives a fan the power to vote to support their favorite fighters, vote on upcoming fights, take part in prize pools, and join exclusive events via Karate Combat's Up Only Gaming App. They want the league to be steered by the most active, informed fans and the best fighters. To make this happen, the Karate Combat founders intend for the KarateDAO to give up to half of all the KARATE tokens away for free over time to fans and athletes via airdrops and special giveaways.",

The innovative pool design will eliminate impermanent loss risk for liquidity providers, and minimize slippage for traders.\n\nThis allows for integration of new assets, more use cases for the single-sided LP tokens, and organic growth of assets based on supply and demand. Platypus further utilizes its capital to mint stablecoins: the USP.

     "description":"SaucerSwap is an open source and non-custodial AMM protocol native to Hedera. Users can swap tokens, provide liquidity, farm, and stake in a fully permissionless environment.\n\nWhen a user stakes SAUCE in the Infinity Pool, they receive a liquid receipt token called xSAUCE based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. The ratio of xSAUCE to SAUCE began at 1:1 and increases over time as the Infinity Pool automatically compounds via SAUCE buybacks sourced from: \n\n1) Swap fees across all liquidity pools\n2) HBAR native staking rewards\n3) Emissions\n\nUsers can deposit xSAUCE in liquidity pools or stake it in Community Pools to earn HTS tokens from projects incubated by HeadStarter.",
